Plastic Playing Cards by Gifford Cheung
====
Plastic Playing Cards are designed to be useful as traditional playing cards that scale well to small sizes (e.g. 40px across) while still retaining the important symbols for cards such as one-eyed Jacks and suicide Kings. 

Under its licensing, I welcome game developers to use Plastic Playing Cards for their own purposes. For more questions or, perhapse, to tell me about how these cards have been used, please contact me at giffordcheung+plastic@gmail.com
